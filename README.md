# Light_SMS_Alert
In this, I have made a circuit which will detect whether the lights of the room are ON or OFF and will send an SMS if one of them has occured.
For this, I have used a Light Dependent Resistor, 2X 330 ohm resistors,jumper wires.

Below is the circuit diagram of the circuit diagram.

Also, below is the result of the code and SMS.
